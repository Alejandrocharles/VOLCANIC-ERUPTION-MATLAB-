# VOLCANIC-ERUPTION-MATLAB-
Created a program using Matlab that simulates the launch of rocks during a volcanic eruption applying the laws of physics.

Simulate a volcanic eruption with and without air resistance. This project features a graphical user interface to input volcano parameters, such as initial velocity, height, angle, and rock diameter.

## Using the User Interface

1. Launch the simulation with MATLAB.

2. Enter the following parameters in the user interface:
   - Initial velocity (m/s)
   - Initial height (m)
   - Launch angle (degrees)
   - Rock diameter (m)

3. Click the "Iniciar Simulaci√≥n" (Start Simulation) button to begin the eruption simulation.

## Simulation Details

The simulation calculates the trajectory of a rock ejected from a volcano. It considers factors like gravity, air resistance, and the physical characteristics of the volcano. The rock's path is displayed in a comet plot.

## Built With
- MATLAB
